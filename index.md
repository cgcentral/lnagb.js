**lnagb.js** is an educational JavaScript library project originally created to
learn how mathematical operations in linear algebra can be implemented using
code. It follows the object-oriented programming model and features a set of
classes that encode linear algebra quantities (such as vectors and matrices) and
their operations, such as matrix reduction, Gaussian elimination, matrix
multiplication, elementary row operations, transposition, and more.

**lnagb.js is free software.** Its source code can be browsed [here][repo].
